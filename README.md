Directory for code on the bio nlp dataset processing and deduplication. Go to each subdirectory for more information on the code.

[`clinical_trial/`](clinical_trial/) - Clinical trial data processing. Check this page for the readme on clinical trial related code.

[`deduplication/`](deduplication/) - Contains code for general deduplication of biomedical research literature and QA datasets. Check this for the readme on deduplication related code for QA and biomedical research data.

[`deduplication/Bio_Med_Research/`](deduplication/Bio_Med_Research/) - Contains code specifically for deduplication of the Bio Med Research dataset.

[`deduplication/QA/`](deduplication/QA/) - Contains code specifically for deduplication of the QA datasets.

The `archive/` directory contains archived code that is no longer used. The `data_loading/` directory were still in the process of developing and not used at this moment.

The `data_information.csv` file contains information about each dataset, such as format, whether it is deduplicated, or if we have access to it right now.
