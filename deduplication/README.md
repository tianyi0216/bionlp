## Deduplication and Preprocessing for Bio Medical Research Data and QA Data

We have the deduplication and preprocessing code for the bio medical research data and also QA data here.

The `Bio_Med_Research/` directory contains the preprocessing code for the bio medical research data. The main function and code
is in the `Bio_Med_Research/utils/` directory, which is more streamlined and `Bio_Med_Research/notebooks` is less important and have what I used to test/run the code.

Similarly, the `QA_Data/` directory contains the preprocessing code for the QA data. The main function and code
is in the `QA_Data/utils/` directory, which is more streamlined and `QA_Data/notebooks` is less important and have what I used to test/run the code.
