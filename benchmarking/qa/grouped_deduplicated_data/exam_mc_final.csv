"Answer the following medical question by selecting from the options [A, B, C, D]: A 12-year-old girl presented to the clinic with a 3-month history of intermittent stridor. Her symptoms were initially most prominent while playing sports and were suspected to be due to asthma or seasonal allergies. However, medical management with albuterol, intranasal fluticasone, and cetirizine failed to provide relief. More recently, the patient’s parents noted that she developed stridor while sleeping and while at rest, prompting the family to present for medical attention.Previous workup, including pulmonary function testing, was concerning for an upper airway obstructive process, for which she was referred to otolaryngology. In-office flexible videostroboscopy revealed a mass in the distal cervical trachea that appeared nearly obstructive. Chest radiography confirmed the presence of an approximately 1.5-cm, well-circumscribed soft tissue mass within the cervical trachea.Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy were performed in the operating room under general anesthesia. This demonstrated an exophytic, pedunculated mass that emanated from the anterior wall of the cervical trachea (Figure 1A and B). The patient was intubated via Seldinger technique to bypass the mass, with a 4.0-mm cuffed endotracheal tube loaded over a 0-degree Hopkins endoscope (Figure 1C). With the airway secured, attention was turned to excision of the mass. Lidocaine, 1%, with epinephrine 1:100 000 was injected in a submucosal plane, and laryngeal scissors were used to excise the attachment of the mass from the tracheal wall.

Rejec- tion is a complex phenomenon involving both cell- and antibody-mediated reactions that destroy the graft. The key to successful transplantation has been the development of therapies that prevent or minimize rejection. Discussed next is how grafts are recognized as foreign and how they are rejected. Immune Recognition of Allografts Rejection of allografts is a response mainly to MHC molecules, which are so polymorphic that most individuals in an outbred population differ in at least some of the MHC molecules they express (except, of course, for identical twins). There are two main mechanisms by which the host immune system recognizes and responds to the MHC mol- ecules on the graft (Fig. 4-23): * Direct recognition. Host T cells directly recognize the allo- geneic (foreign) MHC molecules that are expressed on graft cells. Direct recognition of foreign MHC seems to violate the rule of MHC restriction, which states that in every individual, all of the T cells are educated to recog- nize foreign antigens displayed by only that individual's MHC molecules. It is postulated that allogeneic MHC molecules (with any bound peptides) structurally mimic self MHC and foreign peptide, and so direct recognition of the allogeneic MHC is essentially an immunologic cross-reaction. Because DCs in the graft express high levels of MHC as well as costimulatory molecules, they are believed to be the major culprits contributing to direct recognition. The most impoant consequence of direct recognition is the activation of host CD8+ T cells that recognize class I MHC (HLA-A, -B) molecules in the graft. These T cells differentiate into CTLs, which kill the cells in the graft. Host CD4+ helper T cells may be trig- gered into proliferation and cytokine production by rec- ognition of donor class II MHC (HLA-D) molecules and drive an inflammatory response. Indirect recognition. In this pathway, host CD4+ T cells recognize donor MHC molecules after these molecules are picked up, processed, and presented by the host's own APCs. This sequence is similar to the physiologic processing and presentation of other foreign (e.g., microbial) antigens. The activated CD4+ T cells then recognize APCs displaying graft antigens and secrete cytokines that induce inflammation and damage the graft. The indirect pathway is also involved in the pro- duction of antibodies against graft alloantigens; if these antigens are proteins, they are picked up by host B cells, and peptides are presented to helper T cells, which then stimulate antibody responses. Effector Mechanisms of Graft Rejection Both T cells and antibodies reactive with the graft are involved in the rejection of most solid-organ allografts (Fig. 4-23). T Cell-Mediated Rejection CTLs kill cells in the grafted tissue, causing parenchymal and endothelial cell death (the latter resulting in thrombo- sis and graft ischemia). Cytokine-secreting CD4+ T cells trigger inflammatory reactions resembling DTH in the tissues and blood vessels, with local accumulation of mononuclear cells (lymphocytes and macrophages). Acti- vated microphages can injure graft cells and vasculature. The microvascular injury also results in tissue ischemia, which contributes to graft destruction. Antibody-Mediated Rejection Although T cells are of paramount impoance in allograft rejection, antibodies also mediate some forms of rejection. Alloantibodies directed against graft MHC molecules and other alloantigens bind to the graft endothelium and cause vascular injury through complement activation and recruit- ment of leukocytes. Superimposed on the resulting endo- thelial damage and dysfunction is thrombosis, adding fuher ischemic insult to the injury. Hyperacute rejection is a special form of rejection occur- ring if pre-formed anti-donor antibodies are present in the circulation of the host before transplantation. This may happen in multiparous women who have anti-HLA anti- bodies against paternal antigens encountered during preg- nancy, or in individuals exposed to foreign HLA (on platelets or leukocytes) from previous blood transfusions. Obviously, such antibodies also may be present in a patient who has previously rejected an organ transplant. Subse- quent transplantation in such patients will result in imme- diate rejection (within minutes to hours) because the MORPHOLOGY On the basis of the time course and morphology of rejection reactions, they have been classified as hyperacute, acute, and chronic (Fig. 4-24). This classification is helpful for under- standing the mechanism of rejection, because each pattern is caused by a different type of dominant immunologic reaction. The morphology of these patterns is described in the context of renal transplants; however, similar changes are encoun- tered in other vascularized organ transplants. Hyperacute Rejection Hyperacute rejection occurs within minutes to a few hours after transplantation in a presensitized host and typically is recognized by the surgeon just after the vascular anastomosis is completed. In contrast with a nonrejecting kidney graft, which regains a normal pink color and tissue turgor and promptly excretes urine, a hyperacutely rejecting kidney rapidly becomes cyanotic, mottled, and flaccid and may excrete only a few drops of bloody fluid. The histologic picture is characterized by widespread acute aeritis and aeriolitis, vessel thrombosis, and ischemic necrosis, all resulting from the binding of preformed antibodies to graft endothelium. Viually all aerioles and aeries exhibit char- acteristic acute fibrinoid necrosis of their walls, with narrow- ing or complete occlusion of the lumens by precipitated fibrin and cellular debris (Fig. 4-24, A). circulating antibodies rapidly bind to the endothelium of the grafted organ, with resultant complement activation and vascular thrombosis. With the current practice of screening potential recipients for pre-formed anti-HLA antibodies and cross-matching (testing recipients for the presence of antibodies directed against the donor's lym- phocytes), hyperacute rejection occurs in less than 0.4% of transplant recipients. Acute Rejection Acute rejection may occur within days to weeks of transplan- tation in a nonimmunosuppressed host or may appear months or even years later, even in the presence of adequate immunosuppression. Acute rejection is caused by both cel- lular and humoral immune mechanisms, and in any one patient, one or the other may predominate, or both may be present. On histologic examination, cellular rejection is marked by an interstitial mononuclear cell infiltrate with asso- ciated edema and parenchymal injury, whereas humoral rejection is associated with vasculitis. Acute cellular rejection most commonly is seen within the first months after transplantation and typically is accom- panied by clinical signs of renal failure. Histologic examination usually shows extensive interstitial CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration with edema and mild interstitial hemorrhage (Fig. 4-24, B). Glomerular and peritubular capillaries contain large numbers of mononuclear cells, which also may invade the tubules, leading to focal tubular necrosis. In addition to tubular injury, CD8+ T cells also may injure the endothelium, causing an endothelitis. Cyclosporine (a widely used immu- nosuppressive agent) is also nephrotoxic and induces so- called aeriolar hyaline deposits. Renal biopsy is used to distinguish rejection from drug toxicity. Accurate recogni- tion of cellular rejection is impoant, because patients typi- cally respond promptly to increased immunosuppressive therapy. Acute humoral rejection (rejection vasculitis) caused by antidonor antibodies also may paicipate in acute graft rejection. The histologic lesions may take the form of necro- tizing vasculitis with endothelial cell necrosis; neutrophilic infiltration; deposition of antibody, complement, and fibrin; and thrombosis. Such lesions may be associated with isch- emic necrosis of the renal parenchyma. Somewhat older subacute lesions are characterized by marked thickening of the intima by proliferating fibroblasts, myocytes, and foamy macrophages (Fig. 4-24, C). The resultant narrowing of the aerioles may cause infarction or renal coical atrophy. The proliferative vascular lesions mimic aeriosclerotic thickening and are believed to be caused by cytokines that stimulate proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Local deposi- tion of complement breakdown products (specifically C4d) is used to detect antibody-mediated rejection of kidney allografts. Chronic Rejection Patients present with chronic rejection late after transplanta- tion (months to years) with a progressive rise in serum cre- atinine levels (an index of renal function) over a period of 4 to 6 months. Chronic rejection is dominated by vascular changes, interstitial fibrosis, and loss of renal parenchyma; there are typically only mild or no ongoing cellular parenchy- mal infiltrates. The vascular changes occur predominantly in the aeries and aerioles, which exhibit intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis (Fig. 4-24, D). These lesions ultimately compromise vascular perfusion and result in renal ischemia manifested by loss or hyalinization of glomeruli, interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy. The vascular lesion may be caused by cytokines released by activated T cells that act on the cells of the vas- cular wall, and it may be the end stage of the proliferative aeritis described earlier.",D,"Answer is D because Ref Robbins 9/e p236 REJECTION OF TRANSPLANTS The major barrier to transplantation of organs from one individual to another of the same species (called allografts) is immunologic rejection of the transplanted tissue.

Abdominal pain

Pain is crampy in nature and tends to be more severe the distal the obstruction.
the pain occurs in paroxysms and the patient is relatively comfortable in the intervals between the pain.
audible borborygmi are often noted by the patient simultaneously with the paroxysm of pain.
the pain may become less severe as, distention progresses, probably because motility is impaired in the edematous intestine.
when strangulation occurs, the pain becomes steady and more localized without a colicky component.

Vomiting

Vomiting is almost invariable, and it is earlier and more profuse the higher (proximal) the obstruction.
the vomits initially contains bile and mucus and remains as such if the obstruction is high (proximal) in the intestine.
the more distal the obstruction, the more likely it is that vomits will become feculent. 
Vomiting follows the onset of pain after an interval that varies directly with the level of obstruction.

Constipation and Obstipation

constipation and obstipation will eventually occur in complete obstruction, but some stools and gas may pass initially after the onset of symptoms. In some patients diarrhea may also be seen initially, due to increased peristalsis.

Abdominal distention

abdominal distention occurs as the obstruction progresses and the proximal intestine becomes increasingly dilated.
it is minimal to absent in proximal obstruction, but is pronounced in more distal obstruction.

Temperature

is normal or mildly elevated

Blood in the stool

is rare but does occur in cases of intussusception, or ischemic injury.

Pain is crampy in nature and tends to be more severe the distal the obstruction.
the pain occurs in paroxysms and the patient is relatively comfortable in the intervals between the pain.
audible borborygmi are often noted by the patient simultaneously with the paroxysm of pain.
the pain may become less severe as, distention progresses, probably because motility is impaired in the edematous intestine.
when strangulation occurs, the pain becomes steady and more localized without a colicky component.

Vomiting

Vomiting is almost invariable, and it is earlier and more profuse the higher (proximal) the obstruction.
the vomits initially contains bile and mucus and remains as such if the obstruction is high (proximal) in the intestine.
the more distal the obstruction, the more likely it is that vomits will become feculent. 
Vomiting follows the onset of pain after an interval that varies directly with the level of obstruction.

Constipation and Obstipation

constipation and obstipation will eventually occur in complete obstruction, but some stools and gas may pass initially after the onset of symptoms. In some patients diarrhea may also be seen initially, due to increased peristalsis.

Abdominal distention

abdominal distention occurs as the obstruction progresses and the proximal intestine becomes increasingly dilated.
it is minimal to absent in proximal obstruction, but is pronounced in more distal obstruction.

Temperature

is normal or mildly elevated

Blood in the stool

is rare but does occur in cases of intussusception, or ischemic injury.

A) Premature exfoliation of primary teeth, B) Hypoplastic defects, C) Progressive painless symmetric swelling of cheek bones, D) Both 1 and 3","Answer is D because Cherubism is a disease of children and usually the affected children are normal at birth. The disease starts manifesting at the age of 14 months to 3 years as painless, bilateral symmetrical enlargement of maxilla, and mandible. The rate and extent of jaw enlargement differs considerably among patients and usually, the earlier the lesion appears, the more rapidly it progresses. 
Dental anomalies such as missing teeth, especially 2nd and 3rd molars, crowding, malocclusion, premature loss of deciduous teeth, and delayed eruption of permanent teeth may be noticed.
The disease is self-limiting and the enlargement slows down when the child reaches 5 years of age and stops completely at 12-15 years. At puberty, the lesions begin to regress spontaneously by continuous bone remodelling and at the end of third decade of life, the jaw bones are either clinically normal or with minimum residual deformity.
Reference: Shafer’s Textbook of ORAL PATHOLOGY Eighth Edition page no 468",D,"Answer is D because Cherubism is a disease of children and usually the affected children are normal at birth. The disease starts manifesting at the age of 14 months to 3 years as painless, bilateral symmetrical enlargement of maxilla, and mandible. The rate and extent of jaw enlargement differs considerably among patients and usually, the earlier the lesion appears, the more rapidly it progresses. 
Dental anomalies such as missing teeth, especially 2nd and 3rd molars, crowding, malocclusion, premature loss of deciduous teeth, and delayed eruption of permanent teeth may be noticed.

Because of the extra chromosome, individuals with the condition are usually referred to as ""XXY Males"", or ""47, XXY Males"" Klinefelter syndrome is the most common sex chromosome disorder in males and the second most common condition caused by the presence of extra chromosomes. The condition exists in roughly 1 out of every 500-650 males but many of these people may not show symptoms. Principal effects include hypogonadism and reduced feility. Turner syndrome/Ullrich-Turner syndrome/Gonadal dysgenesis It encompasses several conditions in human females, of which monosomy X (absence of an entire sex chromosome, the Barr body) is most common. It is a chromosomal abnormality in which all or pa of one of the sex chromosomes is absent (unaffected humans have 46 chromosomes, of which two are sex chromosomes). Normal females have two X chromosomes, but in Turner syndrome, one of those sex chromosomes is missing or has other abnormalities. In some cases, the chromosome is missing in some cells but not others, a condition referred to as mosaicism or 'Turner mosaicism'. Occurring in 1 in 2000 -1 in 5000 phenotypic females. There are characteristic physical abnormalities, such as Sho stature, Broad chest, - Low hairline, - Low-set ears, and - Webbed necks. Girls with Turner syndrome typically experience gonadal dysfunction (non-working ovaries), which results in amenorrhea (absence of menstrual cycle) and sterility. Concurrent health concerns are also frequently present, including congenital hea disease, hypothyroidism, diabetes, vision problems, hearing concerns, and many autoimmune diseases. Finally, a specific pattern of cognitive deficits is often observed, with paicular difficulties in visuospatial, mathematical, and memory areas Down syndrome/trisomy 21 Down syndrome is a chromosomal condition characterized by the presence of an extra copy of genetic material on the 21st chromosome, either in whole (trisomy 21) or pa (such as due to translocations). The incidence of Down syndrome is estimated at 1 per 733 bihs It is statistically more common with older parents due to increased mutagenic exposures upon some older parents' reproductive cells. Down syndrome is associated with some impairment of cognitive ability and physical growth, and a paicular set of facial characteristics. Individuals with Down syndrome tend to have a lower-than-average cognitive ability, often ranging from mild to moderate disabilities. The average IQ of children with Down syndrome is around 50, compared to normal children with an IQ of 100. A small number have a severe to high degree of intellectual disability Individuals with Down syndrome may have some or all of the following physical characteristics: - Microgenia (an abnormally small chin), - An unusually round face, macroglossia (protruding or oversized tongue), - An almond shape to the eyes caused by an epicanthic fold of the eyelid, Upslanting palpebral fissures (the separation between the upper and lower eyelids), Shoer limbs, - A single transverse palmar crease (a single instead of a double crease across one or both palms), - Poor muscle tone, and - A larger than normal space between the big and second toes.

Finally, a specific pattern of cognitive deficits is often observed, with paicular difficulties in visuospatial, mathematical, and memory areas Down syndrome/trisomy 21 Down syndrome is a chromosomal condition characterized by the presence of an extra copy of genetic material on the 21st chromosome, either in whole (trisomy 21) or pa (such as due to translocations). The incidence of Down syndrome is estimated at 1 per 733 bihs It is statistically more common with older parents due to increased mutagenic exposures upon some older parents' reproductive cells. Down syndrome is associated with some impairment of cognitive ability and physical growth, and a paicular set of facial characteristics. Individuals with Down syndrome tend to have a lower-than-average cognitive ability, often ranging from mild to moderate disabilities. The average IQ of children with Down syndrome is around 50, compared to normal children with an IQ of 100. A small number have a severe to high degree of intellectual disability Individuals with Down syndrome may have some or all of the following physical characteristics: - Microgenia (an abnormally small chin), - An unusually round face, macroglossia (protruding or oversized tongue), - An almond shape to the eyes caused by an epicanthic fold of the eyelid, Upslanting palpebral fissures (the separation between the upper and lower eyelids), Shoer limbs, - A single transverse palmar crease (a single instead of a double crease across one or both palms), - Poor muscle tone, and - A larger than normal space between the big and second toes. Health concerns for individuals with Down syndrome include a higher risk for congenital hea defects, gastroesophageal reflux disease, recurrent ear infections that may lead to hearing loss, obstructive sleep apnea, thyroid dysfunctions, and obesity.",MedMCQA,0

He reported throat tightness after significant voice use and consistent voice roughness that worsened over several weeks. On examination, he had moderate to severe dysphonia with predominant roughness and strain. Videostroboscopy findings were consistent with fungal laryngitis; a 2-week course of fluconazole was administered. Follow-up videostroboscopy findings demonstrated resolution of the fungal laryngitis but revealed residual fullness of the left false vocal fold and appearance of prolapsed ventricular mucosa obstructing the lateral extent of the left true vocal fold. There was a reduction of lateral excursion of the mucosal wave on the left. The patient continued to report dysphonia and increased vocal effort. A computed tomography scan with contrast showed no specific abnormalities. A direct laryngoscopy for evaluation and treatment was planned. Intraoperatively, there was a firm lesion in the left paraglottic space extending to the lateral aspect of the true vocal fold (Figure, A). A subtle but similar finding was seen on the right true vocal fold, not causing any mass effect (Figure, B). An incision was made in the mucosa of the ventricle overlying the lesion at its lateral extent, and a mucosal flap was elevated over the lesion. This revealed a cartilaginous lesion, which was removed using an AcuBlade CO2 laser (Lumenis) and cup forceps until the cartilaginous edge was smooth within the paraglottic space (Figure, C and D).

"Answer the following medical question by selecting from the options [A, B, C, D]: A man in his 60s was admitted to the hospital for a myocardial infarction. Several days into his stay, he complained of having a hoarse voice for the past year. He denied dyspnea, dysphagia, and reported no weight loss. His medical history was notable for congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and gout. He noted a 10-pack-year smoking history and Agent Orange exposure. On examination, he had no palpable neck masses. The cranial nerves were grossly intact. His voice was rough. He underwent a flexible laryngoscopy, which showed an exophytic yellow-white mid-membranous subepithelial lesion on the bilateral true vocal folds (Figure, A). On stroboscopy, there was decreased vibratory amplitude bilaterally and moderate phase asymmetry. Several weeks later, he underwent an indirect laryngoscopy and vocal fold biopsy in the office. Grossly, pathologic findings showed a chalky white lesion. Histopathologic review showed submucosal amorphous eosinophilic material (Figure, B). The amorphous material was negative for Congo red (Figure, C). Examination of an unstained slide showed needle-shaped birefringent crystals (Figure, D). With this nonspecific but benign diagnosis, and an inability for the patient to go to the operating room secondary to his comorbidities, he agreed to undergo office potassium titanyl phosphate laser photoangiolysis of the lesions to improve vocal fold contour and vibration. More of the chalky material was expressed as the overlying mucosa ablated with very little energy delivered. On follow-up, the lesions persisted but were less bulky.A, Indirect laryngoscopy showing exophytic yellow-white mid-membranous subepithelial lesion on the bilateral true vocal folds.

The electrocardiogram (ECG) at presentation revealed atrial fibrillation: concave upward ST-segment elevations of more than 1 mm in the inferior leads, more prominent in lead III than lead II, along with reciprocal ST-segment depressions in the anterior precordial leads. This was suggestive of an acute inferoposterior myocardial infarction (MI), likely from complete occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA). The coronary angiogram (Figure 1A) confirmed this finding. The left main, the left anterior descending, and the left circumflex coronary arteries were normal. A percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the mid-RCA occlusion just distal to the right ventricular branch was performed. After the PCI, the chest pain resolved, but the patient’s blood pressure was 90/60 mm Hg. Another ECG (Figure 1B) demonstrated resolution of the ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads with a new rSR′ pattern with concave upward ST-segment elevations in leads V1 to V3.A, Coronary angiogram revealing complete occlusion of the mid-right coronary artery (black arrowhead) distal to a large right ventricular branch (white arrowhead).

"Answer the following medical question by selecting from the options [A, B, C, D]: A 62-year-old man with a prior 10–pack-year history of smoking presented with a 3-cm right level IIa lymph node. Fine-needle aspiration results showed metastatic p16-positive squamous cell carcinoma. No mucosal primary site was identified with positron emission tomography, computed tomography, or a head and neck examination. The patient underwent direct laryngoscopy with directed biopsies and bilateral tonsillectomy. Pathology results revealed a 1.8-cm primary cancer in the right tonsil, and the patient received a stage designation of T1 N1 M0. The tumor was intracapsular, and all surgical margins were negative. Multidisciplinary tumor board discussion concluded that surgical and nonsurgical treatment options were available, and the patient elected to proceed with further surgery, which would entail additional directed biopsies at the primary site with additional resection if necessary and selective neck dissection of levels Ib to IV. In preparation for the neck dissection, computed tomography of the neck with contrast was obtained.

Four weeks after the transplant, the patient developed acute vision loss of the left eye. Visual acuity was 20/20 OD and hand motion OS. Anterior segment was remarkable for 1+ hyperemia and 4+ anterior chamber (AC) cell in the left eye. Posterior segment was notable for retinal whitening and occlusive vasculitis in the right eye and more extensive retinal whitening associated with an exudative retinal detachment in the left eye. Microbial and broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and culture results of the AC and vitreous were negative as well as numerous blood cultures and serum fungitell. Despite broad-spectrum intravenous (ie, vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) and intravitreal antibiotics (vancomycin and ceftazidime), antifungals (amphotericin B and voriconazole), and antivirals (foscarnet), the patient’s visual acuity and intraocular inflammation worsened in both eyes to light perception. Over a week, the areas of retinal whitening became elevated owing to enlarging subretinal infiltrates (Figure, A) that were nearly kissing in the right eye (Figure, B). Owing to the diagnostic dilemma, a pars plana vitrectomy with subretinal biopsy was performed in the left eye, and again, microbiological analysis including culture and PCR analysis was inconclusive. Pain worsened, intraocular pressure elevated into the mid-40s mm Hg, visual acuity waned to no light perception, and intraocular inflammation and subretinal infiltrates continued to worsen, producing nearly closed funnel retinal detachments in both eyes, including developing orbital cellulitis in the right eye despite broad-spectrum antimicrobials. During this period, the patient remained afebrile; however, the patient’s white blood cell count was uptrending, raising concern for systemic spread of the infection.A, Intraoperative images from the diagnostic vitrectomy and subretinal biopsy performed on the left eye showing substantial hemorrhagic retinitis with subretinal infiltrate (white arrowhead).

"Answer the following medical question by selecting from the options [A, B, C, D]: A 20-year-old woman was referred by her family physician to a community mental health team in London, United Kingdom. Her mental state had deteriorated progressively over the previous 12 months, following the death of her father. After a period living alone, she had returned to the family home 4 months prior to her presentation and had been noted to be socially withdrawn, preoccupied, and distractible. Her family physician, suspecting a depressive episode, had prescribed citalopram up to a dosage of 40 mg once daily, to no effect. Her family subsequently sought advice from the family physician when the patient was noted to be speaking to herself, expressing concerns about people meaning her harm, and professing the belief that she could hear other peoples’ thoughts.The patient had been born in Sierra Leone after a complicated delivery and had traveled to the United Kingdom as a child with her family, who were fleeing from a civil war. On arrival in the United Kingdom, her family claimed asylum and moved into a small apartment in a high-rise building in central London. Although there was no reported developmental delay, she had struggled academically at school and was bullied for having overweight.

"Answer the following medical question by selecting from the options [A, B, C, D]: An infant girl who was initially seen in the neurosurgical clinic at 7 weeks of age for a left parietal scalp cyst was referred to our clinic after the neurosurgeon discovered a new nasal midline mass  on follow-up examination. Her perinatal and medical histories were otherwise unremarkable. On examination, a 1-cm mobile, well-defined, nontender mass over the nasal dorsum was noted. Findings from the rest of the otolaryngologic examination were normal. Given the superficial nature of the nasal cyst on examination and in an effort to minimize radiation and anesthetic exposure for the patient, computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging were deferred. The preoperative plan was to excise the nasal dermal lesion and carefully inspect for any tracts extending intracranially, which would then warrant imaging and a revised intracranial approach. Intraoperatively, an incision was made above the mass and carried through the subcutaneous tissue to expose a mass with a white wall and pink tissue within. The 0.8 × 0.5 × 0.3-cm mass was freed from the surrounding tissue and excised down to the nasal bone. Careful inspection and palpation after excision revealed no bone involvement or intracranial extension. The neurosurgical team removed the superficial scalp cyst, which was found to be an epidermoid cyst.

On clinical examination, the visual acuity measured 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. Motility, visual fields, and anterior segment examination were normal. Dilated fundus examination revealed tortuous vasculature, multiple cotton wool spots along the arcades and periphery, and granular, hypopigmented retinal lesions without hemorrhage in the macula and temporal periphery in both eyes (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography showed localized areas of full-thickness retinitis (Figure 1B). CMV titers indicated viremia at 2.24 million IU/mL. Despite the patient’s documented UL97 and UL54 mutations, a series of 5 biweekly intravitreal injections of foscarnet and ganciclovir were performed given their vision-threatening lesions. Retinal pathology failed to improve, and the patient eventually refused additional intravitreal therapy because of pain and transiently decreased vision after each injection.Ultra-widefield fundus photograph and optical coherence tomography of a necrotic retinal lesion in the right eye demonstrating (A) multiple cotton wool spots along the arcades with retinal lesions in the temporal periphery (arrowheads) and (B) a cross-section through a temporal lesion along the superior arcade showing full thickness retinitis (arrow).Observation with systemic cidofovir and CMV immune globulin What Would You Do Next?

Examination revealed normal otoscopic findings, and an audiogram demonstrated moderate low-frequency CHL of 45 dB in the right ear and mild 30-dB CHL in the left ear with a normal tympanogram (Figure, A). Two sets of tympanostomy tubes were placed the year before his initial visit for presumed otitis media–related CHL, but his hearing did not improve. An axial computed tomographic (CT) scan performed at that time was interpreted as normal. Owing to concerns of visual changes and possible associated genetic cause for hearing loss (HL), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was ordered 1 year after initial presentation and showed no central or peripheral otologic abnormalities. A genetic evaluation revealed no abnormalities. Follow-up audiograms at 3 and 6 months showed similar persistent CHL despite normal otoscopy results. The patient and family decided to treat the CHL with bilateral hearing aid amplification and a frequency modulation (FM) system at school. After 30 months of persistent CHL with an unknown etiology, a repeated CT scan of the temporal bones was performed (Figure, B and C). Operative intervention vs amplification was discussed, and the patient and family decided to continue with hearing aids because he had improved performance in school.

On examination she had tenderness in the RIF with a positive Blumberg sign; blood testing showed leukocyte count 10 450/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001) without any shift, C-reactive protein 1.29 mg/dL (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 0.331), and hemoglobin 11.4 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10). The Alvarado score was 7. A transabdominal ultrasonographic scan showed a tubular structure in the RIF consistent with a mildly inflamed appendix and stratification of the appendiceal wall (7 mm in the proximal and 11 mm in the appendiceal distal tract). A small amount of free fluid was present in the Douglas pouch. A transvaginal ultrasonographic scan confirmed normal intrauterine gestation with a vital embryo. Working diagnosis was uncomplicated appendicitis and initial conservative management was amoxicillin clavulanate because of the potential risks of miscarriage associated with performing an avoidable appendectomy and general anesthesia during early gestation. The patient initially improved and was discharged home 2 days later with an Alvarado score of 4; oral antibiotic therapy was continued. Three days later she returned to the emergency department with recurrent pain; the clinical and ultrasonographic findings were unchanged, without evidence of complicated appendicitis, intra-abdominal fluid collection, or abscess. The Alvarado score was 5. The patient was admitted to the surgical ward and given intravenous antibiotics. In the next 48 hours the symptoms and pain did not resolve, although inflammatory markers were low and the patient was not septic.

"Answer the following medical question by selecting from the options [A, B, C, D]: A 64-year-old man presented to the otolaryngology clinic with hoarseness of voice for 3 weeks associated with intermittent dry cough. He had no medical history or family history of cancer and was not a smoker. In the absence of other suggestive symptoms, as well as a normal physical examination that did not reveal any enlarged cervical lymph nodes or oropharyngeal or neck mass and an unremarkable nasoendoscopic examination, a diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux was made. The patient was advised to try conservative management with dietary advice and proton pump inhibitors, and a clinical review was scheduled in 6 weeks. The patient only returned 3 months later when his hoarseness became worse. Repeat nasoendoscopy now showed left vocal cord palsy in the paramedian position. In the absence of a history of trauma and associated neurological or systemic symptoms, the main concern was an underlying tumor that impinged on the vagus nerve at various points or its recurrent branch. Results of a computed tomographic (CT) scan showed an ill-defined soft tissue mass, which was likely nodal disease, at the left supraclavicular (Figure 1), as well as the prevertebral and paravertebral region, which partially encased the left common carotid, left subclavian, and left vertebral arteries. This was along the expected course of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve and likely accounted for the left vocal cord palsy. However, the primary site of disease remained unclear. A fused positron emission tomography with CT (PET/CT) scan with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer was then performed.Coronal view of the computed tomographic scan of the patient’s neck, including the left supraclavicular node (yellow arrowhead) and the left common carotid artery (black arrowhead).

His medical history revealed a long-term history of substance abuse with active alcohol and tobacco consumption, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and epilepsy (tonic-clonic seizures, badly controlled owing to a lack of adherence to therapy). Clinical intraoral examination of this fully edentulous patient revealed a nontender, mobile, cystic nodule, approximately 1 × 1 cm on the vestibular side of the lower left lip with outflow of a clear serous fluid on palpation (Figure, A). The lesion was excised surgically and the specimen sent for additional histological examination. After hematoxylin-eosin staining, light microscopy revealed an endophytic growing lesion, which consisted of an acanthotic epidermoid epithelium organized in broad papillary folds, with at its periphery an infiltrating border. At the surface of these papillae, the epithelium was sometimes columnar. Mucocytes were present, individually dispersed throughout the epithelium, but also organized in small tubuloacinar structures emptying onto the surface. The epithelium was infiltrated by neutrophils. Atypia or mitotic figures were absent, and the subepithelial stroma contained normal-appearing seromucous acini (Figure, B and C).A, Clinical presentation of the cystic lesion of the lower left lip.

The patient noted an elevated blood pressure and took clonidine hydrochloride without effect, so he called emergency medical services. His chest pressure resolved after administration of sublingual nitroglycerin en route to the emergency department. On arrival, his blood pressure was 222/120 mm Hg, which subsequently normalized with administration of his home regimen for hypertension. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with a preexisting left bundle-branch block. The troponin I level was initially undetectable but subsequently peaked at 1.3 ng/mL (conversion to micrograms per liter is 1:1). A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular systolic function with regional wall motion abnormalities suggestive of ischemia in the area supplied by the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory the following day for further management of his non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.Coronary angiography revealed a high-grade distal left main coronary artery (LM) bifurcation lesion extending predominantly into the LAD (Figure 1A); the remainder of his coronary tree showed no evidence of obstructive disease. Given the patient’s low SYNTAX (synergy between percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] with taxus and cardiac surgery) score and preference to avoid surgery, he underwent transradial PCI of the LM-LAD using a provisional approach for the left circumflex coronary artery (LCX). Following initial angioplasty, the patient abruptly became hypotensive without chest discomfort despite quick balloon inflations and robust thrombolysis in myocardial infarction grade 3 flow down both the LAD and LCX. There was no evidence of coronary dissection or perforation. The LM-LAD was quickly stented (Figure 1B) as intravenous fluids and escalating doses of intravenous dopamine hydrochloride and epinephrine drips were administered.

"Answer the following medical question by selecting from the options [A, B, C, D]: A 47-year-old woman was seen with left-sided facial weakness and swelling for 2 months. She was diagnosed as having recurrent high-grade serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary and developed these symptoms after cycle 4 of chemotherapy. She was receiving oral antidiabetic agents, and her blood glucose level was 110 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555). Physical examination findings were consistent with left lower-motor-neuron type of facial nerve palsy. She was conscious and well oriented, with no other relevant clinical signs or focal neurological deficits. There was no history of prior COVID-19 infection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was requested, with clinical suspicion of metastasis in view of mildly elevated CA125 levels.The results of MRI of the brain did not reveal any neuroparenchymal or meningeal lesions. However, both maxillary sinuses showed mucosal thickening, which was intermediate to hypointense on T2-weighted imaging and hypointense on T1-weighted imaging with postcontrast enhancement. Computed tomography sections confirmed bony destruction with foci of remodeling involving the walls of the maxillary sinuses (Figure 1).A, Axial T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows T2 heterogeneous soft tissue in the maxillary sinus with perimaxillary inflammatory changes (yellow arrowhead). B, In this axial contrast-enhanced, T1-weighted (T1 + C) image, linear enhancement corresponds to expected course of buccal branch of facial nerve (VII) (white arrow).

He smoked approximately 10 cigarettes per day for 4 years. Results of the physical examination were unremarkable. Radiography of the chest revealed an ill-defined consolidation in the right lower lung field. Laboratory investigations were significant for elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (273 U/L; reference range, 135-225 U/L [to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167]), C-reactive protein (125.3 mg/L; reference range, 0.0-4.9 mg/L [to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524]), and alkaline phosphatase (217 U/L; reference range, 40-129 U/L [to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167]). Computed tomography of the chest confirmed the presence of a dense consolidation involving most of the right middle lobe with right hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathy (Figure, A). He underwent endobronchial ultrasonography-guided transbronchial needle aspiration of a fleshy, whitish endobronchial lesion obstructing both uptakes to the medial and lateral segments. Histologic analysis revealed a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm (Figure, B). Most of the cells were relatively monotonous, with enlarged vesicular nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and a high ratio of nucleus to cytoplasm. Foci of abrupt squamous differentiation, including keratinization and intercellular bridges, were identified. Immunohistochemical staining showed tumor cells to be strongly and diffusely positive for keratin AE1/AE3, cytokeratin 5/6, and p63. However, findings were negative for S-100, melan A, placental alkaline phosphatase, CD56, thyroid transcription factor-1, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, CD45, and cytokeratin 7.

"Answer the following medical question by selecting from the options [A, B, C, D]: An ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) procedure was performed for a neonate born by cesarean delivery at 37 weeks of gestation with a prenatally diagnosed neck mass. Initial laryngoscopy with a Parsons laryngoscope identified airway deviation secondary to mass effect, with intubation ultimately achieved with assistance of a bronchoscope. Examination revealed a large neck mass extending from the mandible to the clavicles, with mass effect causing neck extension and rotation. The mass was multicystic, with prominent vasculature, and a small area of skin necrosis. Following birth, the mass continued to grow, with inability to palpate the sternal notch by day of life 4 (Figure, A). The patient underwent a magnetic resonance image (MRI) on day of life 3 which showed a 15.7 × 10.0 × 14.4-cm midline neck mass with solid and cystic components. Flow voids were present throughout the mass. The mass was isointense to hypointense on T1, and isointense to hyperintense on T2. The patient also underwent a computed tomographic (CT) scan, which demonstrated calcifications present within the multicystic neck mass. Owing to continued growth and risk of airway compromise, the patient was taken to the operating room on day 5 of life for resection of the mass and tracheostomy.

"Answer the following medical question by selecting from the options [A, B, C, D]: A woman in her 50s presented with a 4-week history of a slowly enlarging mass on the left side of the neck. Physical examination revealed a mobile, nontender, 4-cm mass in the left side of the floor of mouth. A contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan of the neck showed a 3.8-cm cystic neck mass in the left floor of mouth (Figure, A). An ultrasonography (US)-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy showed bland-appearing cuboidal to columnar epithelial cells arranged in clusters; no malignant cells were identified. Repeated US-guided FNA biopsy showed a hypercellular specimen composed of numerous fragments of bland-appearing cuboidal and columnar epithelium and granular debris, which was eosinophilic in cell block sections and papillary structures with fibrovascular cores. The hypercellularity was atypical, and a low-grade neoplasm could not be ruled out. At this point, the patient elected observation of the mass and a repeated biopsy. A core biopsy showed a well-differentiated papillary neoplasm with hyalinized fibrovascular cores and some degenerative changes (Figure, B-D). Immunophenotypically, the neoplastic cells were negative for the markers TTF-1, PAX-8, estrogen receptor, and thyroglobulin.

"Answer the following medical question by selecting from the options [A, B, C, D]: A woman in her 20s presents for follow-up of a tuberculin skin test (TST) placed 2 days earlier. The patient is from India and arrived in the United States 1 month ago for graduate studies. She reports no significant medical history and is unaware of any tuberculosis (TB) exposures. She has no symptoms. She received the BCG vaccine as a child. Laboratory testing showed normal chemistry and hematology values and a negative HIV test. The TST reveals an induration of 20 mm. Because of the TST result, the patient has a chest radiograph performed, which was unremarkable. Treatment for latent TB infection (LTBI) was recommended based on the positive TST, negative chest radiograph, and recent US arrival from a high-TB–incidence country. The patient asks whether the positive TST result could be due to her BCG vaccination and wants further testing before beginning therapy. Blood is drawn for an interferon-γ release assay (IGRA; see Figure for results).aExplanation of values: nil (the interferon-γ concentration in plasma from blood incubated without antigen [negative control]); TB antigen minus nil (the interferon-γ concentration in plasma from blood stimulated with 3 relatively specific TB peptides) minus nil; and mitogen minus nil (the interferon-γ concentration in plasma from blood stimulated with mitogen minus nil). The mitogen tube contains a mitogen (phytohaemogglutin-P) that is a nonspecific stimulator of T-cells. It is used as a positive control to ensure the capacity to respond to antigens and also serves as a control for correct blood handling and incubation.bFor this IGRA, 1 mL of blood is drawn into each of 3 tubes (nil [negative control], mitogen [positive control], and TB antigens tube). The TB response (TB antigen minus nil) is calculated as the difference in interferon-γ concentration in plasma from blood stimulated with TB antigens minus the interferon-γ concentration in plasma from blood incubated without antigen (nil). A positive IGRA test result occurs when all of the following criteria are met: (1) the nil value is less than 8 IU/mL; (2) the TB antigen minus nil response is greater than or equal to both 0.35 IU/mL and 25% of the nil value; and (3) there is a positive mitogen response.

"Answer the following medical question by selecting from the options [A, B, C, D]: A man in his 60s with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and dyspnea presented with right lower quadrant abdominal pain. A noncontrast computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen demonstrated splenomegaly, ascites, and a retroperitoneal mass posterior to the pancreatic head. Fine-needle aspiration from the retroperitoneal mass and ascitic fluid revealed no malignant cells. The patient subsequently developed a left-sided lateral chest wall hematoma, and, in retrospect, it was thought that the retroperitoneal mass was actually a hematoma because multiple follow-up studies demonstrated the mass steadily decreasing in size. Echocardiography showed right atrial and ventricular dilatation and increased thickness of the interventricular septum.

"Answer the following medical question by selecting from the options [A, B, C, D]: A 47-year-old African American man with a medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and gastroesophageal reflux disease was given atorvastatin at 40 mg daily for a markedly elevated low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) of 279 mg/dL (millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259). He was subsequently tried on various statins, but owing to hip pain thought possibly because of these agents, a rise in liver enzymes, and persistently elevated LDL-C, he was referred to the Boston Medical Center Lipid Clinic Fasting lipid profile in December 2013 on no lipid-lowering agents included an LDL-C level of 232 mg/dL. He restarted atorvastatin at 40 mg daily because it was determined that his hip pain was more likely because of arthritis than statin therapy. The adherence and effectiveness of lipid-lowering therapy were then routinely monitored by measuring direct LDL-C levels, which dropped to 113 mg/dL in June 2014 and 115 mg/dL in October 2015, respectively. Interestingly, his directly measured LDL was 115 mg/dL in October 2015, but a calculated LDL-C was 170 mg/dL in December 2015. Repeat fasting lipid profiles with simultaneously calculated and directly measured LDL-C levels, apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and lipoprotein (a) (Lp[a]) were subsequently assessed in April 2016 and June 2016. They confirmed a marked difference between the direct LDL-C level and calculated LDL-C levels (Table).The marked discordance between the direct and calculated LDL levels is the result of a laboratory error.The patient has familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (type III hyperlipidemia).The marked discordance between the direct and calculated LDL levels is related to the effects of very LDL (VLDL), intermediate-density LDL (IDL), and/or Lp(a).The marked discordance between the direct and calculated LDL levels is the result of excess VLDL cholesterol only. How Do You Interpret These Test Results? A) The marked discordance between the direct and calculated LDL levels is the result of a laboratory error., B) The patient has familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (type III hyperlipidemia)., C) The marked discordance between the direct and calculated LDL levels is related to the effects of very LDL (VLDL), intermediate-density LDL (IDL), and/or Lp(a)., D) The marked discordance between the direct and calculated LDL levels is the result of excess VLDL cholesterol only.",The answer is option C,C,The answer is option C,JAMA,1

"Answer the following medical question by selecting from the options [A, B, C, D]: A 2-month-old, full-term female presented with a left upper neck mass that was first noted at birth. Her parents reported no fevers, constitutional symptoms, or enlargement of the mass. On physical examination, there was a nontender 4-cm mass in the left submandibular region with no overlying skin changes. Ultrasonography results showed an avascular cystic structure with internal debris and a single thin septation. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the neck soft tissue revealed a 3-cm low attenuation, nonenhancing, cystic-appearing mass that elevated the submandibular gland to the level of the parapharyngeal fat space with medial extension of the lesion into the tongue musculature. The walls were thin except for mildly thickened capsule along the posterior aspect of the lesion (Figure, A and B). Fluid that aspirated from the cyst was serous, and cytology showed mature and anucleate squamous cells with acute inflammation. The mass returned after 3 weeks. Further analysis 8 months after the initial CT via contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a large, multiseptated cystic structure (Figure, C); the capsule of the wall was mildly thickened and was contrast enhancing. At age 12 months, the mass was excised via neck dissection. A lateral component at the level of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was completely excised. An intraoperative rupture of the thin capsule caused some spillage of cystic contents that were milky white in some areas and mucinous in others.Contrast-enhanced computed tomography images.

"Answer the following medical question by selecting from the options [A, B, C, D]: A woman in her 50s presented with a 5-month history of right submandibular swelling and pain, associated with eating and relieved by gland massage. No saliva was expressed on examination. Computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography showed normal-appearing submandibular glands and neck soft tissues. A sialogram showed high-grade stricture approximately 3 to 4 cm into the right submandibular duct orifice. Complete stricture prevented evaluation of the proximal duct and intraglandular portions. Sialendoscopy showed a widely patent right submandibular duct proximally with a segmental takeoff, consistent with the Bartholin duct draining into the Wharton duct distal to a blind pouch identified 2.5 cm from the intraoral duct orifice (Figure, A). Despite a Wharton ductoplasty to improve sublingual gland drainage through the Bartholin duct, the degree of scarring at the hilum and inability to further dilate warranted submandibular gland (SMG) excision. Four months after SMG excision, she developed a right floor of mouth lesion after “burning her mouth” with high-temperature food. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a cystic lesion in the right sublingual space following the Wharton duct (Figure, B). Recurrent floor of mouth swelling (Figure, C) was addressed by repeated marsupialization and eventual sublingual gland excision. Pathologic analysis identified fragments of squamous mucosa with inflammation, cystic space, and compressed granulation tissues consistent with mucous extravasation (Figure, D).

He reported no headaches, numbness, weakness, eye pain, hearing loss, or other neurologic issues. Eight years earlier, he had sustained a fireworks injury to his right eye followed by globe repair and enucleation within 3 days. He had no other significant medical or ocular history.His right eye’s external appearance was normal, and the prosthesis fit well. Uncorrected visual acuity was Snellen 20/70−1 OS (no improvement with pinhole); intraocular pressure was 13 mm Hg. Slitlamp examination results of the anterior segment were normal. Ophthalmoscopy demonstrated 1+ cells in the anterior vitreous and a serous retinal detachment involving the macula and extending from the 2-o’clock to the 10-o’clock position with pigmentary and atrophic changes in the macula. No breaks were noted on scleral depressed examination. Fluorescein angiography showed multifocal areas of early hyperfluorescence with late leakage and diffuse retinal vascular leakage predominantly in the inferior retina (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a thickened choroid and subretinal fluid throughout the macula (Figure 1B). Enhanced depth imaging showed an enlarged choroid throughout the posterior pole, and ultrasonography confirmed extensive inferior retinal detachment (not shown).A, Fluorescein late-phase angiogram shows multifocal areas of posterior choroidal leakage and diffuse retinal vascular leakage in the inferior (detached) retina.

"Answer the following medical question by selecting from the options [A, B, C, D]: In April 2010, a 19-year-old soccer player presented with a 4-week history of pain after a tap against his right knee. Medical and family histories were unremarkable and no abnormalities were found on physical examination. A radiograph of the right knee showed osteolytic lesions in the distal femur and the head of the tibia.On magnetic resonance imaging, the epiphyseal lesions were visualized as cystic and nonsclerotic and extended to the articular surface of the distal femur and proximal tibia (Figure 1). Soft tissue extension was suspected from the tibia. Laboratory test results showed normal blood cell count, renal function, and concentration of C-reactive protein.Aneurysmatic bone cysts were suspected and a biopsy was performed. Histopathological examination detected spindle cell infiltrates with hemorrhages, fragmented trabecular bone, and numerous osteoclastic giant cells proliferating at a rate of 10% suggesting an aggressive giant cell lesion.Since it was still not determined whether the lesions were malignant, flourodeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography/computed tomography was performed and found additional lesions in the left distal femur and the left mandible. Biopsy of the mandible showed the same type of tissue as seen in the right femur and tibia. What Is the Diagnosis?

Surgical drainage was performed, but the swelling persisted. Two months later, nontender preauricular fullness was noted, which prompted the patient to seek a second opinion. In the interim, magnetic resonance imaging of her orbit and parotid glands revealed focal enhancement in the left upper eyelid and superficial lobe of the left parotid gland. She was referred to us for diagnosis and treatment.On examination, visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left eye. Ocular motility was full, and proptosis was absent. The left upper eyelid was thickened (Figure 1A). Eyelid eversion was not possible in the clinic because of mass effect, but a small portion of the tumor was visualized at the supranasal eyelid margin. All eyelashes were intact. A nontender left preauricular mass of 1 cm in diameter was palpable. The remainder of the findings on eye examination were unremarkable. After eyelid eversion in the operating room, the mass measured 35 mm in basal diameter and 5 mm in thickness and demonstrated an amelanotic appearance with a hairpin-shaped vascular pattern suggestive of an epithelial tumor (Figure 1B).A, External photograph demonstrating left upper eyelid fullness.

The surface of stainless steel is highly prone to oxidation, but its passive surface oxide film blocks significant oxygen diffusion to the underlying alloy, thus limiting further oxidation. 
Nonetheless, stainless steel can corrode under certain conditions.  
Severe strain hardening produces highly stressed regions that are anodic to less stressed regions in the presence of saliva. Organic or inorganic deposits and any site of surface roughness on metal may result in localized concentrations of cell corrosion. Thus, corrosion resistance decreases with strain hardening.

There are two clinical subtypes of primary I.T.P, acute and chronic both are autoimmune disorders in which platelet destruction results from the formation of antiplatelet antibodies.

Pathology

The principal morphologic lesions of thrombocytopenic purpura are found in the spleen and bone marrow but they are not diagnostic.
The point to stress is that despite the increased destruction of platelets in spleen the spleen size remains normal.  

Bone Marrow

Bone marrow reveals a modestly increased number of megakaryocytes.
These findings are not specific for autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura but merely reflect accelerated thrombopoiesis, being found in most forms of thrombocytopenia resulting from increased platelet destruction.
The importance of bone marrow examination is to rule out thrombocytopenias resulting from bone marrow failure.
A decrease in the number of megakaryocytes goes against the diagnosis of I.T.P.

Clinical Features

Chronic ITP occurs most commonly in adult women, younger than age 40 years.
Female to male ratio is 4: 1.
The clinical signs and symptoms associated with I.T.P are non-specific for this condition but they are rather reflective of thrombocytopenia.
The disease is often insidious in onset and is characterized by bleeding into the skin and mucosal surfaces.
Cutaneous bleeding occurs in the form of pinpoint haemorrhages, petechiae or ecchymoses. Often there will be a history of easy bruising, nosebleeds, bleeding from the gums and haemorrhages into soft tissues from relatively minor trauma.
Sometimes disease may first manifest with melena, hematuria or excessive menstrual flow.

In the neck, both arteries (right and left) have similar course.
Each artery runs upwards from sternoclavicular joint to the upper border of the lamina of thyroid cartilage (opposite the disc between the 3rd and 4th cervical vertebrae), where it terminates by dividing into internal and external carotid arteries.

Key Concept:
Left and right CCA runs upwards from sternoclavicular joint to the upper border of the lamina of thyroid cartilage (opposite the disc between the 3rd and 4th cervical vertebrae), where it terminates by dividing into internal and external carotid arteries.",MedMCQA,0

Infectious microbes usually enter through these routes and attempt to colonize the hosts. The mechanisms of innate immunity operate at every step in a microbe's attempt to invade. At the site of entry, epithelia serve as physical barriers to infections and eliminate microbes through production of peptide antibiotics and the actions of intraepithelial lymphocytes. If microbes are able to survive and traverse these epithelia, they encounter phagocytes, including neutrophils, which are rapidly recruited from the blood into tissues, and macrophages, which live in tissues under epithelia. The function of these phagocytic cells is to ingest microbes and destroy them by producing microbicidal substances. In response to recogni- tion of microbes, phagocytes, DCs, and many other cell types secrete proteins called cytokines (described later), which promote inflammation and microbial killing and enhance protective immune responses. Cells use several receptors to sense microbes; foremost among these are the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), so named because of homology with the Drosophila Toll protein, that recognize bacterial and viral components (Chapter 2). NK cells kill virus- infected cells and produce the macrophage-activating cyto- kine IFN-g. If the microbes enter the blood, many plasma proteins, including the proteins of the complement system, recognize the microbes and are activated, and their products kill microbes and coat (opsonize) the microbes for phagocytosis.

iv. Sperm antibodies
The treatment of cervical factor thus depends on the cause:
• If it is due to chronic cervicitis/infection - Treatment of infection by antibiotics is the cure.
• If is due to decreased mucus volume - Treatment includes short term supplementation with exogenous estrogen like ethinyl estradiol and use of mucolytic expectorant like guaifenesin. However, their value has not been confirmed.
• If it is due to antisperm antibodies. Treatment options include:
– Use of condom or diaphragm as a barrier method for 3 months. During this period, the antibodies will disappear and conception may occur then.
– Corticosteroids given to female partner can also help in getting rid of these antibodies.
– Intrauterine insemination at the time of ovulation (most acceptable method for cervical factor infertility) or GIFT (Gamete intrafallopian transfer) are very useful techniques in such cases.
• IUI is the best method for treating cervical factor infertility and unexplained infertility.

The treatment of cervical factor thus depends on the cause:
• If it is due to chronic cervicitis/infection - Treatment of infection by antibiotics is the cure.
• If is due to decreased mucus volume - Treatment includes short term supplementation with exogenous estrogen like ethinyl estradiol and use of mucolytic expectorant like guaifenesin. However, their value has not been confirmed.
• If it is due to antisperm antibodies. Treatment options include:
– Use of condom or diaphragm as a barrier method for 3 months. During this period, the antibodies will disappear and conception may occur then.
– Corticosteroids given to female partner can also help in getting rid of these antibodies.
– Intrauterine insemination at the time of ovulation (most acceptable method for cervical factor infertility) or GIFT (Gamete intrafallopian transfer) are very useful techniques in such cases.
• IUI is the best method for treating cervical factor infertility and unexplained infertility. So many clinicians forgo cervical mucus testing and proceed directly to IUI treatment in absence of tubal disease.",MedMCQA,0

Ion channels serve many functions apart from electrical signal transduction: chem ical signalling (Ca2+as a second messenger), transepithelial transport, regulation of cytoplasmic or vesicular ion concentration and pH, and regulation of cell volume. Therefore, ion channel dysfunction can cause diseases in many tissues.The list of human diseases known to be associated with defects in ion channels has grown considerably during the past years. This review gives a short overview of known channelopathies, and focuses in particular on recent findings and on channelopathies that have significantly advanced our physiological insight.Known ion channel diseasesChannelGene |DiseaseCation channels:CHRNA1 /ACHRACHRNA1* Myasthenia congenitaCHRNA4CHRNA4* Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsyCHRNB2CHRNB2* Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsyPolycystin-2PKD2* Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)CNGA3CNGA3* Achromatopsia 2 (color blindness)CNGB1CNGB1* Autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosaCNGB3CNGB3* Achromatopsia 3Sodium channels:Navl.lSCN1A* Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures (GEFSp))Navl.2SCN2A* Generalized epilepsy with febrile and afebrile seizuresNavl.4 paralysisQSCN4A* Paramyotonia congenitaQ potassium aggressive myotonia, hyperkalemic periodicNavl.5SCN5A* Long-QT syndrome, progressive familial heart block type I, Brugada syndrome (idiopathic ventricular arrhythmia)SCN1BSCN1B* Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures (GEFSp))ENaCaSCNN1A* Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1)ENaCbSCNN1B* PHAI, Liddle syndrome'2 (dominant hypertension)ENaCgSCNN1G* PHAI, Liddle syndromeQPotassium channels:Kvl.lKCNA1* Episodic ataxia with myokymiaKCNQl/KvLQTlKCNQ1Autosomal dominant long-QT syndrome (Romano-Ward)Autosomal recessive long-QT syndrome with deafness (Jervell-Lange-Nielsen)KCNQ2KCNQ2* BFNC (epilepsy), also with myokymiaKCNQ3KCNQ3* BFNC (epilepsy)KCNQ4KCNQ4* DFNA2 (dominant hearing loss)HERG/KCNH2KCNH2* Long-QT syndromeKirl.l/ROMKKCNJ1* Bartter syndromeQ (renal salt loss, hypokalemic alkalosis)Kir2.1/IRK/KCNJ2KCNJ2* Long-QT syndrome with dysmorphic features (Andersen syndrome)Kir6.2/KATpKCNJ11* Persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI)SUR1SUR1* PHHIKCNE1 /MinK/ISKKCNE1* Autosomal dominant long-QT syndrome (Romano-Ward) Autosomal recessive long-QT syndrome with deafness (Jervell-Lange-Nielsen)KCNE2/MiRPlKCNE2* Long-QT syndromeKCNE3/MiRP2KCNE3* Periodic paralysisCalcium channels:Cavl.lCACNA1S* Hypokalemic periodic paralysisQ, malignant hyperthermiaCavl.4CACNA1F* X-linked congenital stationary night blindnessCav2.1CACNA1A* Familial hemiplegic migraineQ, episodic ataxiaQ, spinocerebellar ataxia type 6QRyRlRYR1* Malignant hyperthermia, central core diseaseRyR2RYR2Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia type 2 Chloride channels:CFTRABCC7* Cystic fibrosisQ, congenital bilateral aplasia of vas deferensClC-1 CLCNl* Autosomal recessive (Becker) orC1C-5 CLCN5dominant (Thomsen) myotonia * Dent's diseaseQ (X-linkedC1C-7 CLCN7proteinuria and kidney stones) * Osteopetrosis (recessive orCIC-Kbdominant)CLCNKB* Bartter syndromeQ type IIIBarttin BSNDBartter syndrome typeQ IVGLRA1 (associated with sensorineural deafness)GLRA1 * Hyperekplexia (startle disease)GABAal GABRA1* Juvenile myoclonus epilepsyQGABAg2 GABRG2* EpilepsyGap junction channels:Cx26GJB2* DFNA3 (autosomal dominantCx30 GJB4hearing loss)DFNB1 (autosomal recessive hearing loss)DFNA3Cx31 GJB3* DFNA2Cx32 GJB1* CMTX (X-linked Charcot- Marie-Tooth neuropathy)",C,"Answer is C because Ans. is 'c' i.e., Tay-Sach's disease Ion channels provide pores for the passive diffusion of ions across biological membranes.They are often highly selective for a particular ionic species, leading to a classification into sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), chloride (Cl)and unspecific cation channels.

These include :? a) Sadism : Sexual gratification is obtained or increased from acts of physical cruelty or infliction of pain on one's paner. It is seen more commonly in men. To obtain sexual gratification, the sadist may bite, beat, whip, produce cuts on the victim, etc. b) Lust murder : In extremes of sadism, murder serves as a stimulus for the sexual act and becomes the equivalent of coitus, the act being accompanied by erection, ejaculation, and orgasm. c) Necrophagia : (Necros =corpse; phagia = to eat) : This is extreme degree of sadism in which the person after mutilating the body, sucks or licks the wounds, bites the skin, drinks blood, and eats the flesh of his victim to derive sexual pleasure. d) Masochism : Sexual gratification is obtained or increased by the suffering of pain. Masochists get pleasure from being beaten, abused, toured, humiliated, enslaved, degraded, or dominated by their sexual paner. e) Necrophilia : In this condition, there is a desire for sexual intercourse with dead bodies. It is said to have sadomasochistic foundation and that decomposition, foul smell and coldness act as stimulants. f) Fetishism : A fetish is an abnormal stimulus or object of sexual desire.

"Answer the following medical question by selecting from the options [A, B, C, D]: A 20-year-old female comes to the physician because she has never had a perioD. She has no medical problems, has never had surgery, and takes no medications. Examination shows that she is a tall female with long extremities. She has normal size breasts, although the areolas are pale. She has little axillary hair. Pelvic examination is significant for scant pubic hair and a sho, blind- ended vaginal pouch. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient? A) No intervention is necessary, B) Bilateral gonadectomy, C) Unilateral gonadectomy, D) Bilateral mastectomy","Answer is B because This patient has the findings that are most consistent with androgen insensitivity syndrome (formerly called testicular feminization syndrome). This syndrome results from genetic defects leading to abnormal androgen receptor function. Patients with androgen insensitivity syndrome are genotypically males (46, XY) but phenotypically females-with breasts and no external male genitaliA. The reason that breasts develop is that estrogens, which are expressed at pubey and which also result from peripheral conversion of androgens, act upon the breast tissues unopposed by androgens because of the androgen receptor defect. This unopposed estrogen leads to breast growth and the resultant breasts are normal sized, although they have undeveloped nipples and pale areolae. There are no internal female organs, because mullerian-inhibiting substance is present during development. There are no external male organs because of the androgen receptor defect. Testicles do exist, but they are intra- abdominal. The gonads have a high rate of malignant degeneration in patients with androgen insensitivity syndrome and therefore, after pubey, they should be removed bilateral gonadectomy. It is impoant to wait until after pubey so that full development can take place. To state that no intervention is necessary (Choice A)is incorrect. If the gonads are not removed from a patient with androgen insensitivity syndrome there is a significant risk that the patient will develop a gonadal malignancy. To perform a unilateral gonadectomy (Choice C) is incorrect. To leave one of the gonads in would still run the risk of malignant degeneration in that gonad.

"Answer the following medical question by selecting from the options [A, B, C, D]: A young, tall, thin male with arachnodactyly has ectopia lentis in both eyes. The most likely diagnosis is A) Marfan's Syndrome, B) Marchesani's Syndrome, C) Homocystinuria, D) Ehler's Danlos syndrome","Answer is A because Marfan Syndrome Marfan syndrome is a disorder of connective tissues,manifested principally by changes in the skeleton, eyes,and cardiovascular system. Its prevalence is estimated to be 1 in 5000. Approximately 70% to 85% of cases are familial and transmitted by autosomal dominant inheri- tance. The remainder are sporadic and arise from new mutations. Pathogenesis. Marfan syndrome results from an inherited defect in an extracellular glycoprotein called fibrillin 1. There are two fundamental mechanisms by which loss of fibrillin leads to the clinical manifestations of Marfan syndrome: loss of structural suppo in microfibril rich connective tissue and excessive activation of TGF-b signaling. Each of these is discussed below. * Fibrillin is the major component of microfibrils found in the extracellular matrix . These fibrils provide a scaffolding on which tropoelastin is deposited to form elastic fibers. Although microfibrils are widely distributed in the body, they are paicularly abundant in the aoa, ligaments, and the ciliary zonules that suppo the lens; these tissues are prominently affected in Marfan syndrome. Fibrillin occurs in two homologous forms, fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, encoded by two separate genes, FBN1 and FBN2, mapped on chromo- somes 15q21.1 and 5q23.31, respectively. Mutations of FBN1 underlie Marfan syndrome; mutations of the related FBN2 gene are less common, and they give rise to congenital contractural arachnodactyly, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by skeletal abnormalities. Mutational analysis has revealed more than 600 distinct mutations of the FBN1 gene in individuals with Marfan syndrome. Most of these are missense mutations that give rise to abnormal fibrillin-1. These can inhibit polymerization of fibrillin fibers (dominant negative effect). Alternatively, the reduction of fibrillin content below a ceain threshold weakens the connective tissue (haploinsufficiency). * While many clinical manifestations of Marfan syndrome can be explained by changes in the mechanical propeies of the extracellular matrix resulting from abnormalities of fibrillin, several others such as bone overgrowth and myxoid changes in mitral valves cannot be attributed to changes in tissue elasticity. Recent studies indicate that loss of microfibrils gives rise to abnormal and excessive activation of transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b), since normal microfibrils sequester TGF-b and thus control the bioavailability of this cytokine. Excessive TGF-b signaling has deleterious effects on vascular smooth muscle development and it also increases the activity of metalloproteases, causing loss of extracellular matrix. This schema is suppoed by two sets of observations. First, in a small number of individuals with clinical features of Marfan syndrome (MFS2), there are no mutations in FBN1 but instead gain-of-function mutations in genes that encode TGF-b receptors. Second, in mouse models of Marfan syndrome generated by mutations in Fbn1, administrationof antibodies to TGF-b prevents alterations in the aoa and mitral valves. Clinical Features. Although mitral valve lesions are more frequent, they are clinically less impoant than aoic lesions. Loss of connective tissue suppo in the mitral valve leaflets makes them soft and billowy, creating a so-called floppy valve . Valvular lesions, along with lengthening of the chordae tendineae, frequently give rise to mitral regurgitation. Similar changes may affect the tricuspid and, rarely, the aoic valves. Echocardiography greatly enhances the ability to detect the cardiovascular abnormalities and is therefore extremely valuable in the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. The great majority of deaths are caused by rupture of aoic dissections, followed in impoance by cardiac failure.

The maturing positive experience with TKIs has now relegated its use to after first-line TKI failures. An impoant question is the optimal timing and sequence of TKIs and allogeneic SCT (whether allogeneic SCT should be used as second- or third-line therapy). Among patients who present with or evolve to blastic phase, combinations of chemotherapy and TKIs should be used to induce remission, followed by allogeneic SCT as soon as possible. The same applies to patients who evolve from chronic to accelerated phase. Patients with de novo accelerated-phase CML may do well with long-term TKI therapy (estimated 8-year survival rate 75%); the timing of allogeneic SCT depends on their optimal response to TKI (achievement of complete cytogenetic response). Among patients who relapse in chronic phase, the treatment sequence depends on several factors: (1) patient age and availability of appropriate donors; (2) risk of allogeneic SCT; (3) presence or absence of clonal evolution and mutations; (4) patient's prior history and comorbidities; and (5) patient and physician preferences Nowdays with the availability of effective TKI primary treatment modality for chronic and accelerated phase of CML is TKI therapy.If patient fails to respond to TKI then allogenic stem cell transplantation is the treatment of choice.so SCT is still the most effective treatment for accelerated and blast phase of CML Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are used as an interim therapy to achieve minimal CML burden.

"Answer the following medical question by selecting from the options [A, B, C, D]: Which of the following agent causes muscle rigidity A) Fentanyl, B) Halothane, C) Ketamine, D) Droperidol","Answer is A because Opioids can increase muscle tone and may cause muscle rigidity. The incidence of rigidity noted with opioid anesthetic techniques varies significantly because of differences in dose and speed of opioid administration, the concomitant use of N2O, the presence or absence of muscle relaxants, and the patient's age. Opioid-induced rigidity is characterized by increased muscle tone that sometimes progresses to severe stiffness with the potential for serious problems. Clinically significant opioid-induced rigidity usually begins just as or after a patient loses consciousness. Mild manifestations of rigidity, such as hoarseness, can occur in conscious patients. Vocal cord closure is primarily responsible for the difficult ventilation with a bag and mask that follows the administration of opioids. The precise mechanism by which opioids cause muscle rigidity is not clearly understood. Muscle rigidity is not the result of a direct action on muscle fibers because it can be decreased or prevented by pretreatment with muscle relaxants. Mechanisms of opioid-induced muscle rigidity involving the CNS have been postulated. Pharmacologic investigation using selective agonists and antagonists suggest that systemic opioid-induced muscle rigidity is primarily caused by activation of central m receptors, whereas supraspinal d1 and k1 receptors may attenuate this effect. Some aspects of opioid-induced catatonia and rigidity (increased incidence with age, muscle movements resembling extrapyramidal side effects) are similar to Parkinson's disease and suggest similarities in neurochemical mechanisms. Patients with Parkinson's disease, paicularly if they are inadequately treated, may experience reactions such as dystonia following opioid administration. Pretreatment with or concomitant use of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants can decrease the incidence and severity of rigidity. Induction doses of sodium thiopental and subanesthetic doses of diazepam and midazolam can prevent, attenuate, or successfully treat rigidity. Rapid administration of larger doses of opioids (paicularly fentanyl, sufentanil, remifentanil, and alfentanil) can induce chest wall rigidity severe enough to make ventilation with bag and mask nearly impossible.

"Answer the following medical question by selecting from the options [A, B, C, D]: A 27 year old female feels a lump in her breast and schedules an appointment with her doctor for examination. A tissue biopsy is taken and examined, with multiple areas showing only benign features. Which of the following findings implies an increased risk of subsequently developing invasive carcinoma? A) Apocrine metaplasia, B) Blue-domed cysts of Bloodgood, C) Duct ectasia, D) Sclerosing adenosis","Answer is D because Sclerosing adenosis is a type of proliferative fibrocystic disease that is often seen with other variants of fibrocystic disease. It is a proliferation of small ducts and myoepithelial cells near the terminal duct lobular unit. It also is characterized by fibrosis that distos the glands and lobules into a whorled pattern. The demonstration of this on biopsy, as with other proliferative fibrocystic changes, implies an increased risk for subsequent invasive breast cancer. Apocrine metaplasia is the term used to describe a transformation of ductal epithelial cells to eosinophilic cells resembling apocrine sweat gland epithelium. This is a benign, common, non-proliferative change that is not associated with increased cancer risk. A blue-domed cyst of Bloodgood is a fluid-filled cyst, sometimes up to 5 cm in size, that appears blue grossly before it is incised. When incised, the fluid is serous and dark- colored. These cysts are pa of benign non-proliferative fibrocystic disease and do not carry increased cancer risk. Duct ectasia is characterized by a large dilated duct with inspissated material. it is associated with periductal inflammation and fibrosis of the large collecting ducts under the areola. It is common in elderly women, although the cause is not clear. There is no increased risk of cancer. Ref: Wyatt C., Kemp W.L., Moos P.J., Burns D.K., Brown T.G. (2008). Chapter 17.

Primary infection is a paicularly common cause of bronchiectasis. The most widely cited mechanism of infectious bronchiectasis is the ""vicious cycle hypothesis,"" in which susceptibility to infection and poor mucociliary clearance result in microbial colonization of the bronchial tree. Some organisms, such asPseudomonas aeruginosa, exhibit a paicular propensity for colonizing damaged airways and evading host defense mechanisms. Impaired mucociliary clearance can result from inherited conditions such as CF or dyskinetic cilia syndrome, and it has been proposed that a single severe infection (e.g., pneumonia caused byBordetella peussisorMycoplasma pneumoniae) can result in significant airway damage and poor secretion clearance. The presence of the microbes incites continued chronic inflammation, with consequent damage to the airway wall, continued impairment of secretions and microbial clearance, and ongoing propagation of the infectious/inflammatory cycle.

"Answer the following medical question by selecting from the options [A, B, C, D]: A 70 year old man comes to clinical attention with progressive memory loss, urinary incontinence, and gait instability. MRI of the brain shows dilatation of the ventricular cavities, while the cerebral coex appears normal. No infarcts are seen. Repeated lumbar punctures reveal occasional increases in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. A biopsy of the frontal coex demonstrates the absence of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment? A) Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as tacrine, B) Aspirin, C) L-DOPA, D) Ventricular shunt","Answer is D because This is an ""interdisciplinary"" question, which begins with a clinical scenario and ends by testing your knowledge of pathophysiology and pharmacology. The clinical presentation has the classic triad of memory loss, urinary incontinence, and gait abnormalities characteristic of normal pressure hydrocephalus (recently renamed intermittently raised pressure hydrocephalus). This condition results from intermittent increases in CSF pressure, leading to progressive damage to cerebral white matter and dilatation of the ventricles. No significant coical atrophy is present. The lack of Alzheimer-related changes in the biopsy and the measurements of CSF pressure suppo the diagnosis. Relief of CSF pressure can be obtained by placing a ventricular shunt, which usually improves clinical symptomatology. Tacrine and other inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase are used in the symptomatic therapy of Alzheimer disease. The pathology of this disease includes degeneration of cerebral cholinergic systems, such as the basal nucleus of Meyne, which project to the neocoex and are involved in memory and learning. Acetylcholinesterase degrades acetylcholine after release from presynaptic boutons. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors therefore enhance the concentration of acetylcholine and amplify cholinergic neurotransmission. Aspirin is used to prevent aggregation and adhesion of platelets in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. Prophylactic aspirin treatment lowers the incidence of transient ischemic attacks and brain infarcts. L-DOPA is a precursor of dopamine, the neurotransmitter of the nigrostriatal neurons that degenerate in Parkinson disease. L-DOPA, especially in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor, is therefore used in the treatment of this disorder. Ref: Ropper A.E., Ropper A.H. (2012). Chapter 209.

Ultrasound reveals a 9 cm cystic lesion adjacent to the pancreas. An impoant complication that might occur if this cyst ruptured would be? A) Anaphylactic shock, B) Carcinomatosis, C) Disseminated infection, D) Intestinal hemorrhage","Answer is D because The patient most likely has a pancreatic pseudocyst, which is a complication of pancreatitis. Pancreatic pseudocyst is not a true cyst; it is lined by granulation tissue and collagen. It contains pancreatic juices and lysed blood, so rupture would spill the active digestive enzymes onto the adjacent viscera, paicularly the stomach, small intestine, and transverse colon. Digestive action produces potentially severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Anaphylactic shock results from massive activation of the IgE-mediated branch of the immune system. Pancreatic secretions do not elicit an IgE response. The classic abdominal cyst that ruptures, producing anaphylactic shock, is a hydatid cyst. Carcinomatosis is widespread serosal spread of a carcinoma, typically due to tumor spillage into a body cavity. Although this may occur with pancreatic mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, this disease is far less likely to occur than is pancreatic pseudocyst in a patient with chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatic pseudocyst is not an infective disease. Although septic abscesses do occur in the abdomen, and may even complicate a pancreatic pseudocyst, the danger of rupture is more associated with tissue destruction by pancreatic enzymes than with infection.

"Answer the following medical question by selecting from the options [A, B, C, D]: Biphasic reaction on blood pressure is seen With the administration of: A) Adrenaline, B) Nor adrenaline, C) Dopamine, D) Dopamine","Answer is A because A moderate dose of adrenaline given by I.V produces a rapid increase in BP followed by a fall - a biphasic response. The systolic rises due to alpha 1 mediated vasoconstriction and beta 1 mediated increase in hea rate, the force of contraction and thereby cardiac output. Action on beta receptors is more persistent and as the action on alpha receptor wears off the action of beta 2 receptors gets unmasked resulting in decreased BP due to a fall in diastolic.

"Answer the following medical question by selecting from the options [A, B, C, D]: A 29-year-old non smoker man presents with  sneezing, post-nasal drip, eye watering, and a itch of his posterior pharynx. These symptoms tend to be worse in the spring and summer and have been bothering him since mid-April, about 1 month ago. His past medical history is remarkable only for mild asthma induced by being outdoors. He takes no regular medications but does take diphenhydramine on occasion. Most appropriate diagnostic test at this time is? A) Blood radioallergosorbent test, B) None, the diagnosis is based solely on the history and physical examination, C) Intradermal testing, D) Serum protein electrophoresis","Answer is B because This patient most likely has seasonal allergic rhinitis. It has been shown quite convincingly that the diagnosis is based on the history and physical alone and that further work-up is not cost-effective and should be reserved for refractory cases.
The blood radioallergosorbent test reliably detects allergen-specific IgE antibodies in the serum and quantifies their concentrations. Intradermal testing involves the introduction of a measurable amount of allergen into the dermal layer of the skin. Serum protein electrophoresis is not routinely used to aid in the diagnosis of rhinitis. It is commonly used in the diagnosis of sickle cell disease and multiple myeloma.
Skin-prick testing involves the application of a small amount of concentrated allergen to the skin; it is then ""pricked"" through to the epidermal layer. This type of testing is less sensitive than intradermal testing.",B,"Answer is B because This patient most likely has seasonal allergic rhinitis.
